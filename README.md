# Academic Assessment System 📊  
**Real-time Student Feedback Platform using Flutter & Firebase**

A modern **Flutter + Firebase** application designed to help faculty instantly assess student understanding during a lecture using live responses and analytics.

This project is suitable for:
- 🎓 **College / B.Tech Final Year Project**
- 🚀 **Startup MVP**
- 💼 **Portfolio / Resume / Recruiter Review**

---

## 🔥 Problem Statement

Traditional faculty feedback systems are:
- Delayed
- Not topic-specific
- Collected only at semester end

Faculty have **no real-time insight** into whether students understood a concept *during* the class.

---

## 💡 Solution

The **Academic Assessment System** enables:
- Instant session creation by faculty
- Public link sharing with students
- One-tap response submission (A/B/C/D)
- **Live dashboard updates**
- Secure history access (per faculty only)

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 👨‍🏫 Faculty
- Secure login (Firebase Authentication)
- Create topic-based sessions
- Generate public shareable link
- Live response monitoring
- Visual analytics (pie chart)
- End session & view history
- Session data visible **only to owner**

### 👨‍🎓 Students
- No login required
- Open link from any browser
- Submit response instantly
- Hosted globally via Firebase Hosting

---

## 🔐 Security Architecture

| Layer | Security |
|----|----|
| Authentication | Firebase Auth |
| Database | Firestore Rules |
| Data Isolation | Faculty UID based |
| Student Access | Write-only |
| Hosting | HTTPS (Firebase) |

🔒 **Students cannot read session data**  
🔒 **Faculty can only read their own sessions**

## 🧠 Technology Stack

| Category | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Flutter (Material 3) |
| Backend | Firebase Firestore |
| Authentication | Firebase Auth |
| Hosting | Firebase Hosting |
| Charts | Custom Flutter Widgets |
